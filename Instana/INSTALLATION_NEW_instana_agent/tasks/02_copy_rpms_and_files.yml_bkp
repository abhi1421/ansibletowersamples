    # 1. lookup('ansible.builtin.fileglob', ...): Finds matching files in the role's 'files/' directory.
    # 2. []: Encapsulates the lookup result in a list. This is a workaround if fileglob sometimes returns a string.
    # 3. | flatten: Ensures it's a flat list, even if the lookup returned a list within a list.
    # 4. | first: Takes the first item from the list (the first matching file path).
    # 5. | default(''): If the list is empty (no file found), defaults to an empty string.
    # 6. | string | trim: Ensures the final result is a clean string without leading/trailing whitespace.
